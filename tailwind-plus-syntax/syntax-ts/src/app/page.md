## Quick Start Example

Transform your student data into actionable insights in minutes.

### Connect to Your Data Source

Whether you're working with Aeries SIS, PowerSchool, or another student information system, we design pipelines that extract, transform, and load your data securely:

```bash
# Example: Secure API connection to Aeries SIS
curl -X GET "https://your-district.aeries.net/api/v5/schools" \
  -H "AERIES-CERT: your-certificate-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file with your Aeries API credentials:

```bash
AERIES_API_URL=https://aeries.example.com/api
CERT_PATH=/path/to/client.crt
KEY_PATH=/path/to/client.key
PORT=3000
```

### Run the Server

Start the development server:

```bash
cargo run --release
```

The server will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
