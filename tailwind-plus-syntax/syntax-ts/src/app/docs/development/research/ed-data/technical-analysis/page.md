## Overview

This analysis was extracted from an Ed-Data tour video transcript to understand how educational data systems structure and present information. This research may inform how the Aeries API presents similar data types.

## Data Sources & Systems

### Primary Sources
- California Department of Education (CDE)
- EdSource partnership for data accessibility
- K-12 Education data for California districts
- Financial reports and student/staff demographics
- State test results and graduation rates
- Discipline and absenteeism data

### System Architecture
The Ed-Data platform provides:
- **Free Access**: No commercial interests or agendas
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: District, school, county, and state levels  
- **Historical Data**: Going back to 2009-10 school year
- **Multiple Formats**: Web interface, downloadable files, comparison tools

## Key Data Categories

### 1. Student Demographics
- **Census Day Enrollment**: Count of students enrolled on first Wednesday in October
- **Cumulative Enrollment**: End-of-year student count (used for graduation rates, discipline data)
- **Average Daily Attendance**: Count of days attended (important for funding)

{% callout type="warning" %}
**Important Note**: These are completely different counts taken at different times and in different ways. They should not be interchanged.

### 2. Student Groups and Classifications
- **Unduplicated Pupil Count**: Starting point for Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF)
- **Free and Reduced Price Meals**: Economic indicators
- **English Learners**: Language acquisition status
- **Redesignated Fluent English Proficient**: Annual count of students redesignated from EL status
- **Foster Youth Count**: Specialized student population tracking
- **Ethnic Diversity Index**: Custom calculation showing racial/ethnic diversity

### 3. Performance Metrics
- **CASP Test Results**: California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress
- **English Language Arts and Mathematics**: Four achievement levels over five years
- **College and Career Readiness**: Cohort graduation and dropout rates
- **UC/CSU A-G Requirements**: College admission requirement completion
- **Four-Year Adjusted Cohort**: Complex graduation rate calculation

### 4. Financial Data
- **General Fund Revenues and Expenditures**: Primary school district funding
- **Federal and State Resources**: Restricted funding sources  
- **COVID Relief Funding**: Trackable through restricted resources
- **Current Expense of Education**: Cost of direct educational services to students
- **Per-Pupil Expenditures**: Calculated using Average Daily Attendance (ADA)

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Data Presentation
- **Five-Year Chunks**: Graphs presented in five-year periods
- **Interactive Drill-Down**: Detailed data access through expandable views
- **Table Data Export**: Excel downloads with expanded categories
- **Sharing Tools**: Link generation for specific data views
- **Filter Capabilities**: Remove specific data points or categories

### Navigation System
- **White Menu**: State, County, District, School, Comparisons
- **Red Menu**: County, District, School selection with "Go" button
- **Search Functionality**: Entity search with county/district context
- **Cookie-Based Navigation**: Remembers last viewed entity

### Comparison Tools
- **Flexible Filtering**: By enrollment size, district type, geographic area
- **Sorting Capabilities**: By any data element (enrollment, test scores, demographics)
- **Entity Limits**: Maximum 1,500 entities for export (browser timeout prevention)
- **State/County Inclusion**: Compare districts to broader averages

## Data Quality and Limitations

### Known Gaps
- **Special Education Data**: Limited availability due to separate data systems
- **Charter School Financial Data**: Different reporting structure, not compatible with SAC system
- **Staff Demographic Data**: Pending release from CDE
- **Physical Fitness Data**: Discontinued during pandemic, unlikely to return

### Data Timeliness
- **Unaudited Actuals**: Financial data reported by districts to state
- **Audit Changes**: Data may change after official audit
- **Release Schedule**: New data available in phases throughout the year
- **Historical Preservation**: Closed schools' data maintained for historical analysis

## Relevance to Aeries API

### Potential Integration Points
1. **Data Structure Patterns**: How to organize hierarchical education data
2. **Comparison Functionality**: Tools for district/school comparisons
3. **Export Capabilities**: CSV, Excel formats for data export
4. **Filtering Systems**: Advanced filtering and sorting mechanisms
5. **Time Series Data**: Historical data presentation patterns

### Implementation Considerations
- **Performance**: Large datasets require careful pagination and filtering
- **User Experience**: Progressive disclosure of detailed information
- **Data Export**: Multiple format support with size limitations
- **Navigation**: Breadcrumb and contextual navigation patterns

## Technical Specifications

### Data Volume
- **Statewide Coverage**: All California K-12 public schools and districts
- **Historical Depth**: 13+ years of historical data
- **Multiple Metrics**: Demographics, performance, financial, operational data
- **Export Limits**: 1,500 entity maximum per download

### System Requirements
- **Browser Compatibility**: Works across modern browsers
- **Cookie Usage**: Navigation support only, no personal data tracking
- **Performance**: Optimized for large dataset visualization
- **Accessibility**: Public access, no authentication required
