## Overview

The Aeries API Rust implementation provides a high-performance, type-safe interface to the Aeries Student Information System. This getting started guide will walk you through everything you need to begin developing with the API.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Rust 1.75+** (recommended via rustup)
- **Aeries API Certificate** and private key from your district
- **Network Access** to your Aeries server
- **Basic knowledge** of Rust development (helpful but not required)

## What You'll Learn

In this section, you'll learn how to:

1. **Install** Rust and project dependencies
2. **Configure** your environment for development
3. **Run** your first API server
4. **Make** your first API call
5. **Test** your installation

## Next Steps

Once you've completed the getting started guide, you'll be ready to:

- Explore the [API Reference](/docs/api) for detailed endpoint documentation
- Follow [User Guides](/docs/guides) for common tasks and workflows
- Dive into [Development Documentation](/docs/development) if you want to contribute
